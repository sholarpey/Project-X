    <p>Hi, welcome to my blog. I'm Solape Jegede, a lifestyle blogger who lives in Nigeria. I enjoy writing about myself, life experiences, and movies among others. Here, you get to learn from these experiences, gain some knowledge, and live life with me.</p>

    <h1 id="about.html">About</h1>
<p>I work as a Digital Marketer in Bulk Buyers Connect, Abuja, Nigeria.
As a young graduate, I was so confused as to which step to take. I didn’t have any plans and it was hard to choose a career path with little experience. During my NYSC program, I was privileged to work in an IT company will allowed me to acquire more skills, improve on those I already have and most of all, gain knowledge. I learned how to put my thoughts into words and share them with people.</p>
</p>Having to start up my own blog is a great step for me and I’m very proud. 
I enjoy reading books, watching movies, making researches, and having educative conversations among others. These experiences have helped me to broaden my horizons. Someday, I hope to be as good of a writer as Sidney Sheldon was, and also impact on people’s lives.
Being a lifestyle blogger gives me the opportunity to share my life journey with you through all the ups and downs. It also gives room for individual improvement which is paramount. You can get to know more about me via my social media pages, I’d love to hear from you!</p>
